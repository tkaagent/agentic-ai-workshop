## Getting Started

You should have received an **e-mail** with the details of the workshop (if not, ask the workshop support team). It should have included the following details related to the workshop:

- Repository link
- VM details
  - ${PROVIDED_VM_IP}
  - ${PROVIDED_VM_PORT} (if nothing provided, port is default SSH port (e.g. 22))
- private SSH key (`id_rsa_claude`)

You need to keep all these for you and not share them with anyone else (only  workshop support team if needed).

You might have already done a few of these steps. If so, feel free to follow up and skip the ones you have already done.

### Configure your SSH config files

Before starting the workshop, you must configure your `SSH client` for seamless access to all workshop components:

#### 1. Workshop VM SSH Access

To access the workshop VM, you'll need to configure SSH authentication using the **SSH private key** provided via email (`id_rsa_claude`) or you can also find a copy of it in the [utils/](./utils/) folder of this repo (e.g. `utils/id_rsa_claude`).

1. **Save** the private key file to a secure location on your local machine (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa_claude`). 

2. **Ensure** the key has the correct permissions **600** to prevent SSH from rejecting it due to overly permissive access rights. 

    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ```

3. **Test** your connection to the VM using the following command:

    ```bash
	ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_claude claude@${PROVIDED_VM_IP} -p ${PROVIDED_VM_PORT}
	```

	or remember, if ${PROVIDED_VM_PORT} was not provided, no need to add default port 22 (skipping -p option)

    ```bash
	ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_claude claude@${PROVIDED_VM_IP}
	```

	replacing `${PROVIDED_VM_IP}` with the VM's IP address and `${PROVIDED_VM_PORT}` with the VM's port provided in the e-mail. The public SSH RSA key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa_claude.pub`) was already added to the user `claude` at the workshop VM and the cRPD devices (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) so you can SSH into the workshop VM and the cRPD devices without being asked for the password.
	
4. For convenience, add below code to your `~/.ssh/config` file. This will allow you to connect to the workshop VM simply by typing **ssh naf-ws-vm**. No password asked! Keep your private key secure and never share it with others or commit it to version control systems.

Add the following configuration to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
# Workshop VM Configuration
Host naf-ws-vm
    HostName ${PROVIDED_VM_IP}
    User claude
    Port ${PROVIDED_VM_PORT}
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

#### 2. Container Lab cRPD Routers Access
Configure access to the containerized routers through the VM (please, pay attention to the ProxyCommand line containing the jump host VM named configured before **naf-ws-vm**):

⚠️ Make sure you do not have other `Host` entries defined with the same name (e.g. `naf-ws-vm`, `pe1`, `pe2`, `pe3`, `pe4`, `pe5`, `pe6`, `p`, `ce1` and/or `ce2`) or you will face conflicts when connecting. If so, add a prefix (e.g. `naf`) and remember to use it when connecting to them.

```bash
# cRPD Devices (via Workshop VM jump host (e.g. naf-ws-vm))
Host pe1
    HostName 172.20.20.11
    User claude
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ProxyCommand ssh -l claude naf-ws-vm nc %h 22 2>/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Host pe2
    HostName 172.20.20.12
    User claude
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ProxyCommand ssh -l claude naf-ws-vm nc %h 22 2>/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Host pe3 p
    HostName 172.20.20.13
    User claude
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ProxyCommand ssh -l claude naf-ws-vm nc %h 22 2>/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Host pe4 ce1
    HostName 172.20.20.14
    User claude
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ProxyCommand ssh -l claude naf-ws-vm nc %h 22 2>/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Host pe5 ce2
    HostName 172.20.20.15
    User claude
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ProxyCommand ssh -l claude naf-ws-vm nc %h 22 2>/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Host pe6
    HostName 172.20.20.16
    User claude
    IdentityFile ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SSH_RSA_CLAUDE} # e.g. /Users/my_user/.ssh/id_rsa_claude
    ProxyCommand ssh -l claude naf-ws-vm nc %h 22 2>/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

5. Test your connection to the VM using now the following command (it does not have neither the user nor the SSH key implicit in the command):

    ```bash
	ssh naf-ws-vm
	```

If it does not work, probably it is because you have been assigned a sandbox in [JCL](https://www.jcl.juniper.net/) (Juniper Cloud Labs) and your public IP has not been allowed (by the support team!). Ask them to do it, or if you got the e-mail with the URL from JCL, just follow below steps. Else, you can skip next step:

#### 3. Add your public IP to JCL
Figure out which is your public IP (seen from JCL (Juniper Cloud Labs)). Go to this website and copy the IP:

https://test-01.cloudlabs.juniper.net/

You should see something like this:

![JCL your public IP](images/JCL.your.public.IP.png)

Copy this IP and add it to your JCL Sandbox allowed network prefixes. In order to do that, go to `COMMANDS` and on the right hand side, click on `Add Allow Network Prefixes`:

![JCL allow network prefixes](images/JCL.add.allow.network.prefix.png)

Add it and then click `Run`.

![JCL add allow network prefixes](images/JCL.run.allow.network.prefix.png)

You should see a window with a console output running a script to add your prefix to JCL so you can access your sandbox remotely.

![JCL Console output](images/JCL.Console.Output.Allow.Public.IP.png)

#### 4. Test SSH Connectivity
Verify your SSH configuration:

```bash
# Test VM access
ssh naf-ws-vm

# Test router access (after any use case topology has been deployed! Else, it will not work)
ssh pe1
ssh pe2
ssh pe3
ssh pe4
ssh pe5
ssh pe6
```

### Connect to your VM

1. **Check aliases**

A few aliases have been added to the VM so you can navigate to the interesting folders easily:

```bash
$ alias | grep go
alias gojunosmcp='cd ~/mcps/junos-mcp-server'
alias golinuxmcp='cd ~/mcps/linux-mcp-server'
alias gomcps='cd ~/mcps/'
alias gousecase1='cd ~/workspace/uc1-lldp'
alias gousecase2='cd ~/workspace/uc2-ifs-desc'
alias gousecase3='cd ~/workspace/uc3-ospf'
alias gousecase4='cd ~/workspace/uc4-isis'
alias gousecase5='cd ~/workspace/uc5-j2'
alias gousecase6='cd ~/workspace/uc6-l3vpn'
alias gousecase7='cd ~/workspace/uc7-jvd'
alias gousecase8='cd ~/workspace/uc8-health'
alias goutils='cd ~/workspace/utils'
alias goworkspace='cd ~/workspace'
```

2. **Navigate to your JunOS MCP server repo**:

    Use the alias (`gojunosmcp`) to go directly and explore it:

	```bash
	$ gojunosmcp
	claude@clab-vm:~/mcps/junos-mcp-server (main)$ 
	```

3. **Navigate to your Linux MCP server repo**:

    Use the alias (`golinuxmcp`) to go directly and explore it:

	```bash
	$ golinuxmcp
	claude@clab-vm:~/mcps/linux-mcp-server (main)$ 
	```

4. **Navigate to your workspace**:

    Use the alias (`goworkspace`) to go directly to it:

	```bash
	goworkspace
	claude@clab-vm:~/workspace (main)$ 
	```

5. **Familiarize with the repo and the use cases**:

	Here you can find all the documentation and use cases that we are going to explore during the workshop:

	```bash
	claude@clab-vm:~/workspace (main)$ ls -la
	```

	Use the alias to go to the different use cases (e.g. `gousecase1`) and read the README.md files to understand each use case. You can open them with the webbrowser or VSCode Preview for a better experience.

	```bash
	$ gousecase1
	claude@clab-vm:~/workspace/uc1-lldp (main)$ 

	cat README.md
	```

### Configure Visual Studio Code

Once you've successfully established SSH access to the workshop VM, you can use **Visual Studio Code** to connect to your assigned VM, and use it as your development environment. Follow these steps to set up your development workspace:

1. Install and use the SSH Remote Extension: Open Visual Studio Code and install the **Remote - SSH** extension from the Extensions marketplace if you haven't already. This red square in below picture is the icon of the **extensions** section:

![VSCode extensions icon](images/VSCode.extensions.icon.png)

2. Once installed, click on the green/blue remote connection icon in the bottom-left corner of VS Code. Select **Connect to Host** and choose the VM from your SSH config, or enter the connection string directly (e.g. `naf-ws-vm`). VS Code will establish a remote connection and reload in the context of the VM. This arrow is pointing to it:

![VSCode extensions icon](images/VSCode.remote.ssh.png)

3. Open the Workshop Folder: After connecting to the remote VM, go to `File` > `Open Folder`. Navigate to and select the **~/workspace** directory, then click **OK**. This will open the workshop repository in your VS Code workspace.

4. Install the **ContainerLab** extension in the workshop VM. With your remote connection active, open the Extensions view. Search for **ContainerLab** and install the ContainerLab VS Code extension. Note that this extension will be installed on the remote VM, not your local machine, which is exactly what we want for this workshop.

6. Install the other extensions in the workshop VM the same way as above:
    - Markdown Preview Enhanced (recommended)
    - Markdown All in One (recommended)
    - Auto-Open Markdown Preview (recommended)

7. In the Explorer sidebar, navigate to the root folder of the repository and locate the **README.md** file. Double-click it to open and review the workshop instructions and repository documentation. The **Auto-Open Markdown Preview** extension should open it in a formatted view.

You're now ready to begin working with the lab environment directly from Visual Studio Code!

### MCP hosts

Different AI platforms can serve as MCP hosts, allowing for enhanced agentic capabilities through standardized integrations. MCP hosts act as environments where AI models can:

- Connect to external tools and services
- Access real-time data and APIs
- Execute commands and interact with systems
- Maintain context across complex workflows

You can choose between these 2 MCP host applications:

- Claude Desktop
- Github Copilot (integrated with Visual Studio Code)

However, the workshop will be run with Claude Desktop.

#### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop application is the selected MCP host for the workshop. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with agentic AI capabilities while maintaining control over external connections.

1. **Install Claude Desktop**

	Install Claude Desktop application in your laptop if you did not have it installed.

2. **Launch Claude Desktop**

	Open your `Claude Desktop` application in your laptop.

3. **License**

	Configure your license (recommended **PRO**) as mentioned in the pre-requisites of this workshop. You can find more details at:

	- https://www.claude.com/pricing

4. **Configure Claude Desktop MCP servers**

	Go to your `Claude Desktop` settings (e.g. `Claude Desktop` > `Settings`).

	![Claude Desktop settings](images/Claude.Desktop.settings.png)

	Go to developer and then click on edit the configuration file (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`) with any Text Editor (VSCode recommended!)

	![Claude Desktop Developer](images/Claude.Desktop.Developer.Edit.Config.png)

	**NOTE**: Remember to use the same `hostname` that you used in your SSH config file (e.g. `naf-ws-vm`). If you do it wrong, you will not be able to connect Claude Desktop to your MCPs passwordless.

	Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` config file with the following data. Make sure if you got already other MCP servers configured that you do it right (respect `,` and `{` or `}` from the JSON file).

	```json
	{
		"mcpServers": {
			"junos-mcp-jcl-naf": {
				"type": "stdio",
				"command": "ssh",
				"args": [
					"naf-ws-vm",
					"/home/claude/.local/bin/uv",
					"run",
					"/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
					"/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/jmcp.py",
					"-f",
					"/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/devices.json -t stdio"
				],
				"cwd": "/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/"
			},
			"linux-mcp-jcl-naf": {
				"type": "stdio",
				"command": "ssh",
				"args": [
					"naf-ws-vm",
					"/home/claude/.local/bin/uv",
					"run",
					"/home/claude/mcps/linux-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
					"/home/claude/mcps/linux-mcp-server/linux-mcp-server.py"
				],
				"cwd": "/home/claude/mcps/linux-mcp-server/"
			}
		},
		"globalShortcut": ""
	}
	```

	Windows users should install Git Bash and replace the 2 command lines with this:
	```json
	"command": "C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/ssh.exe",
	```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop application**

	`Close` and `open` again the application to reload the configuration.

6. **Check Claude Desktop logs** 

	If you do not see any errors while launching the app, you should be fine. Else check the `logs` related to your MCP servers (**linux-mcp-jcl-naf.log** and **junos-mcp-jcl-naf.log**) and begin your AI-assisted network automation journey!

	![Claude Desktop always allow](images/Claude.Desktop.logs.png)

7. **Next steps**

	Now, whenever you start using your MCP and Claude recognizes it can make use of any tools from your MCP servers, you will be prompted if it can use that specific tool the first time it ever makes use of it. Click **ALWAYS_ALLOW** if you Do not want to be prompted again, or **ALLOW_ONCE** if you prefer to be prompted every time it make uses of it (not recommended).

	![Claude Desktop always allow](images/Claude.Desktop.Always.Allow.png)

#### Github Copilot (in Visual Studio Code)

GitHub Copilot in VS Code represents a different approach to agentic AI integration, primarily focused on development workflows within the IDE environment. However, it can also be used as an MCP host. In order to configure it as your MCP host, follow these steps:

1. **Launch Visual Studio Code**

	Go to your `Visual Studio Code` and connect to the remote VM you have been assigned with the Remote SSH extension.

2. **Open folder in Remote VM**

	Open folder named `workspace` and create a folder inside it named `.vscode`. Create a file named `mcp.json` and add below content:

	```json
	{
		"servers": {
			"junos-mcp-jcl-naf": {
				"type": "stdio",
				"command": "ssh",
				"args": [
					"naf-ws-vm",
					"/home/claude/.local/bin/uv",
					"run",
					"/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
					"/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/jmcp.py",
					"-f",
					"/home/claude/mcps/junos-mcp-server/devices.json -t stdio"
				]
			},
			"linux-mcp-jcl-naf": {
				"type": "stdio",
				"command": "ssh",
				"args": [
					"naf-ws-vm",
					"/home/claude/.local/bin/uv",
					"run",
					"/home/claude/mcps/linux-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
					"/home/claude/mcps/linux-mcp-server/linux-mcp-server.py"
				]
			}
		}
	}
	```

	This screenshot is an example of it:

By the end, you'll have a comprehensive record of the steps done and the automation workflows you've successfully executed.
